<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>chatGPT</h1><br/><p>ChatGPT</p><p></p><p>The dmesg output you provided shows logs related to the Bluetooth hardware and firmware on your system. The logs indicate that the Bluetooth subsystem is being initialized and the firmware is being loaded successfully each time the device boots. However, there&#39;s an ongoing issue with the hci0 Bluetooth interface, specifically with &quot;Malformed MSFT vendor event: 0x02&quot; and &quot;HCI LE Coded PHY feature bit is set, but its usage is not supported.&quot; These messages suggest that the device encounters an unsupported feature during initialization.</p><p>Key Observations:</p><p></p><p>    Firmware Loading: The Bluetooth device (hci0) is consistently loading firmware (intel/ibt-18-16-1.sfi) and applying Intel DDC parameters successfully.</p><p></p><p>    Repeated Initialization: The same sequence of messages appears multiple times, indicating that the Bluetooth device is either being reset or re-initialized frequently.</p><p></p><p>    Malformed MSFT Vendor Event: The message &quot;Malformed MSFT vendor event: 0x02&quot; points to an issue with processing a vendor-specific event, likely related to a feature that the current setup doesn&#39;t fully support.</p><p></p><p>    HCI LE Coded PHY Feature: The &quot;HCI LE Coded PHY feature bit is set, but its usage is not supported&quot; message implies that a specific Bluetooth feature (likely related to Bluetooth 5.x&#39;s LE Coded PHY) is enabled in the hardware but not supported by the current firmware or software stack.</p><p></p><p>Steps for Troubleshooting:</p><p></p><p>    Update Bluetooth Firmware/Drivers: Ensure that your Bluetooth firmware and drivers are up to date. This can often resolve compatibility issues or add support for newer features.</p><p></p><p>    Check for Kernel Updates: Sometimes these issues are fixed in newer kernel versions. Consider updating your kernel if a newer stable release is available.</p><p></p><p>    Blacklist Unsupported Features: If the unsupported feature is not needed, you can look into disabling it. This might involve blacklisting specific modules or passing parameters to the Bluetooth stack during startup.</p><p></p><p>    Consult Logs During Bluetooth Operation: Monitor the system logs (journalctl -b or dmesg -w) while attempting to use Bluetooth to check for any additional errors or issues.</p><p></p><p>    Check Distribution-specific Forums: Since Bluetooth issues can be specific to the hardware and distribution, check forums or documentation specific to your Linux distribution (e.g., Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu) for known issues or fixes.</p><p></p><p>    Test with Another Device: If possible, test the Bluetooth functionality with a different Bluetooth device to rule out hardware-specific issues.</p><p></p><p>If you&#39;re looking to use specific Bluetooth features that are not working due to these errors, updating your system and ensuring all related packages are up to date is your best first step.</p></div>
