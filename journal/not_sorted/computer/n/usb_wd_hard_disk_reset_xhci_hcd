Reset USB Device Using xhci_hcd
A "reset high-speed USB device" message indicates that the USB device is being reset to correct communication errors or to recover from a malfunction. This is a common behavior for USB controllers to ensure stable communication with connected devices. For instance, the message "usb 1-3.3: reset high-speed USB device number 20 using ehci_hcd" appears frequently in system logs, suggesting that the USB device numbered 20 is being reset by the USB controller (ehci_hcd or xhci_hcd) to maintain proper functionality.

In some cases, these resets can indicate underlying issues such as hardware problems, interference, or driver issues. For example, a user reported constant resetting of USB devices on a system running the 6.8.4 kernel, which could be due to severe problems or enabled kernel debug options.

If you encounter frequent resets, it might be worth checking the USB cables, the USB ports, or the connected devices for any physical damage or compatibility issues. Additionally, updating the USB driver or the kernel might resolve the issue.
