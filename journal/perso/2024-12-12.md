Dating

The controversy around the zodiac's dating, known as the "Dendera Affair", involved people of the likes of Joseph Fourier (who estimated that the age was 2500 BC).[10] Champollion, among others, believed that it was a religious zodiac. Champollion placed the zodiac in the fourth century AD.[11] Georges Cuvier placed the date between 123 AD and 147 AD.[12] His discussion of the dating summarizes the reasoning as he understood it in the 1820s.

Sylvie Cauville[13] and Éric Aubourg dated it to 50 BC through an examination of the planetary configuration. It depicts the five planets known to the Egyptians, in a configuration that occurs once every thousand years, and the identification of two eclipses.[14] The solar eclipse indicates the date of March 7, 51 BC: it is represented by a circle containing the goddess Isis holding a baboon (the god Thoth) by the tail. The lunar eclipse indicates the date of September 25, 52 BC: it is represented by an Eye of Horus locked into a circle.

Dating of the Dendera Zodiac

The Dendera Zodiac, a significant artifact from ancient Egypt, has been the subject of much scholarly debate regarding its dating. The controversy primarily revolves around the interpretations and methodologies used by various scholars to ascertain its age.

Historical Context and Early Estimates

The earliest estimates of the Dendera Zodiac’s date were made by notable figures such as Joseph Fourier, who suggested an age of approximately 2500 BC. This early dating was based on limited archaeological context and understanding of Egyptian chronology. However, as more evidence came to light, particularly in the 19th century, scholars began to refine their estimates.

Jean-François Champollion, known for deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs, placed the zodiac in the fourth century AD. His reasoning was influenced by his broader studies of Egyptian religion and culture, which he believed were reflected in the zodiac’s imagery. Georges Cuvier later proposed a narrower timeframe between 123 AD and 147 AD based on stylistic analysis and comparisons with other artifacts from that period.

Modern Dating Techniques

In more recent years, researchers Sylvie Cauville and Éric Aubourg have utilized astronomical events to provide a more precise dating for the Dendera Zodiac. They dated it to around 50 BC through careful examination of planetary configurations depicted in the zodiac. Their analysis focused on two significant celestial events: a solar eclipse on March 7, 51 BC, and a lunar eclipse on September 25, 52 BC.

The solar eclipse is represented in the zodiac by an image of the goddess Isis holding a baboon (which symbolizes Thoth). This representation aligns with historical records of eclipses that would have been observable from Egypt at that time. Similarly, the lunar eclipse is indicated by an Eye of Horus within a circle, further supporting their dating hypothesis.

Cauville and Aubourg’s approach highlights how specific astronomical phenomena can serve as reliable markers for dating ancient artifacts. The configuration they identified occurs only once every thousand years among the five planets known to ancient Egyptians—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—adding credibility to their findings.

Conclusion

In summary, while early estimates placed the Dendera Zodiac at various dates ranging from 2500 BC to as late as the fourth century AD, modern scholarship using astronomical data has led to a consensus around a date close to 50 BC. This conclusion is supported by specific celestial events that correlate with depictions found within the zodiac itself.
