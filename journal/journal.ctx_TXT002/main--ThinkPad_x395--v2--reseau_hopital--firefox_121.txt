Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue
        
                Firefox detected a potential security threat and did not continue to duckduckgo.com because this website requires a secure connection.
        
                  What can you do about it?
          duckduckgo.com  has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS),  which means that Firefox can only connect to it securely. You can’t add  an exception to visit this site.
          
The  issue is most likely with the website, and there is nothing you can do  to resolve it. You can notify the website’s administrator about the  problem.
