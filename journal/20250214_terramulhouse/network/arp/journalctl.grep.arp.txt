ðŸ’¡ Summary
This warning is not an error, just an informational message.

If you donâ€™t need to filter bridge traffic, you can ignore it.

If you rely on firewalls with Docker/VM bridges, follow the fix above.

Let me know if you'd like help verifying if your current iptables rules apply to bridged containers or VMs.
