Here's a refined analysis of your nmap results for 192.168.1.63:

✅ Summary:
This is a Linux-based device running Apple AirPlay (AirTunes) and something exposing a Nagios Remote Data Processor (NRDP) interface.

🔍 Port-by-Port Analysis
Port	State	Service	Details
80	filtered	HTTP	Likely firewalled or blocked (no response)
443	filtered	HTTPS	Same — port filtered by host or firewall
7000	open	RTSP	AirTunes rtspd 377.40.00 → an Apple AirPlay service
8080	filtered	http-proxy	Common for web admin panels; firewalled
8081	filtered	blackice-icecap	Not responding (custom admin port, maybe?)
9080	open	Unrecognized, HTTP-based	Responds with Server: NRDP/2024.1.3.0-fa011dec5f0 and status=ok → Nagios Remote Data Processor (NRDP)

🧠 What This Suggests
The device is very likely an Apple-compatible networked speaker, smart device, or media server, such as:

A smart speaker (Sonos, Denon, etc.)

A HomePod

An Apple TV or similar receiver

It runs an embedded HTTP server (NRDP) on port 9080, used for status reporting or telemetry (not unusual for smart devices).

It is probably not running a full-featured web interface — most admin ports are filtered.

AirTunes (port 7000) confirms that the device advertises itself as an AirPlay target.

🧪 You Can Try:
📡 Check the AirPlay Broadcast
bash
Copier
Modifier
avahi-browse -art | grep -i airplay
Or:

bash
Copier
Modifier
dns-sd -B _airplay._tcp
🌐 Access 9080 from a browser:
cpp
Copier
Modifier
http://192.168.1.63:9080/
You may see just a status=ok text — that’s NRDP replying.

🏷️ Try to resolve device hostname (if mDNS is on):
bash
Copier
Modifier
ping -c1 192.168.1.63
avahi-resolve-address 192.168.1.63
📌 Conclusion
You’re most likely dealing with a networked audio or smart media device that:

Supports Apple AirPlay

Uses NRDP (Nagios) for simple network diagnostics or service checks

Restricts access to typical admin ports (80/443/8080)

Would you like help identifying the physical device from its MAC or tracking down who owns it on the network?
